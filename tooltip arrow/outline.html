		<p>Don't go to bed, with no price on your head. No, no, don't do it. Fon't do the crime, if you can't do the time, yeah, don't do it. And keep your eye on the sparrow, when the going gets narrow. Don't do it, don't do it.</p>

With Zandor, their leader, and his wife, Tara, and son, Dorno, they team up to protect their planet from sinister invaders! All-strong! All-brave! All-heroes! They're The Herculoids!</p>
